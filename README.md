# legacy-opengl-switch

Legacy OpenGL setup for the Nintendo Switch (libnx+glad+EGL).
Fixed Function Pipeline like glVertex, glNormal, glColor, glTexCoord are supported, easing the port of legacy OpenGL applications (and games).
⚠️ New projects shouldn't use legacy OpenGL for several reasons such as performance (https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Legacy_OpenGL)

This is part of Gen7 Engine's used and developed utilities open sourceing process for the greater good.
It's used to allow Gen7's 3D developments running on old hardware to be ported and tested easily on modern hardware by expecting the same behavior.
